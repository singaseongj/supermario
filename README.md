# Super Mario

A tiny Super Mario-style background renderer built in JavaScript. The project uses vanilla ES modules and a lightweight static server for local development.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server (defaults to port 3000):
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the canvas.

Assets live in `img/` and level data lives in `levels/`. The code in `js/` uses relative paths so everything resolves correctly when served from the project root.
